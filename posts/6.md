Charles Correa actually wrote a series of essays himself, and I am going to use those as his "blog" that features himself: http://charlescorrea.net/pdfs/

 - Correa was very interested in the relationship between student and teacher. He explained an Indian folktale about a guru, his disciples, and a follower of his. Then, he drew parallels between that story and the current state of architectural education. He was skilled at applying art to the real world. http://charlescorrea.net/pdfs/essay02.pdf

 - Correa, once again interested in architectural education, examines the differences between artists and engineers and the varying amount of glamour in each profession. He concludes by suggesting that his alma mater (MIT) integrate more interdisciplinary courses in their architectural studio classes with civil and environmental engineers. http://charlescorrea.net/pdfs/essay03.pdf

 - When I read essay #2 it ended on a rather dark note for the fact that the essay as a whole had been very inspiring. I considered that as rather jarring but when I read essay #5 the next day I was met with the same type of abrupt and disconcerting ending. What starts as an inspiring essay ends on a down note contrary to the excitement of the piece. I am not sure what fact I can draw from this other than the fact that Correa was not just a skilled architect, but a surprisingly adept writer as well. http://charlescorrea.net/pdfs/essay05.pdf
